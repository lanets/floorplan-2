## Installing dev environment

Make sure you have [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed on your machine.

Then install Gulp and TypeScript globally.
```
$ npm install -g typescript gulp
```

Finally, install this package
```
$ npm install
```

## Building

To compile and build the TypeScript code, run this gulp task:
```
$ gulp build
```

While developping, you can ask gulp to recompile the project
every time you change a file. Just start gulp in the background using :
```
$ gulp
```
